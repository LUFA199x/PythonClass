## Python Loops, functions, modules and libraries
#### Loops (for/while): Loops are used to repeatedly run a block of code.
##### for loop
Using the for loop, a piece of code is executed once for each element of a sequence (such as a list, string, or tuple).
Here is an example of a for loop that prints each programming language in a list:
`languages = ['Python', 'Go', 'JavaScript']

# for loop
for language in languages:
    print(language)`
