## Python Loops, functions, modules and libraries
*** ### Loops
#### Loops (for/while): Loops are used to repeatedly run a block of code.
### for loop
Using the `for loop`, a piece of code is executed once for each element of a sequence (such as a list, string, or tuple).
Here is an example of a for loop that prints each programming language in a list:

`languages = ['Python', 'Go', 'JavaScript']`
`# for loop`
`for language in languages:`
`    print(language)`

##### Output:
`Python`
`Go`
`JavaScript`

### while loop
The `while` loop is used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a condition is True. Here's an example of a while loop that prints the numbers from 1 to 5:

`i = 1`
`n = 5`
`# while loop from i = 1 to 5`
`while i <= n:`
`print (i)`
`i = i + 1`

##### Output:
`1`
`2`
`3`
`4`
`5`
